# Bino

## Overview

Bino it's a binary emulation tool written in Golang and powered by [Radare](https://rada.re) that is able to emulate executable instructions from PE, ELF and Mach-O. It can be used to evaluate encryption and decryption routines, check the CPU state in some block of code and to "execute" different architecture code and acelerate a lot of reverse engineering tasks.
